I have made a photographic website. A photographer can take inspiration from the photos that get uploaded on this site. Also, there is a join now button through which a user can join our photographic community. Once the user clicks on the join us button, they get redirected to a new webpage that contains a form. If the user fills the form his information gets saved into a database.


The future scope of this project is to make the site responsive and to add the functionality by which a user can-
1) upload an image on the site.
2) can download an image from the site.
3) can book a freelancer photographer from the website. 

Make pull requests. Updation on this is site high will hlghly appreciable.
Thank You
